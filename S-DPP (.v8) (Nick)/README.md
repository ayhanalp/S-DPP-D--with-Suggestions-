This repository contains code for the AADI Lab rover domain. Code is currently implemented in python.
A primitive rover domain visualizer is implemented alongside the rover domain code, but it is currently a work in progress.

Currently main.py is setup to run the rover domain code using a CCEA to train the Neural Networks.

To run the code use: python3 main.py
